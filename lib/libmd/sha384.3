.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sha512.h
.Ft void
.Fn SHA384_Init "SHA384_CTX *context"
.Ft void
.Fn SHA384_Update "SHA384_CTX *context" "const u_int8_t *data" "size_t len"
.Ft void
.Fn SHA384_Final "u_int8_t digest[48]" "SHA384_CTX *context"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Li SHA384_
functions calculate a 384-bit cryptographic checksum (digest)
for any number of input bytes.
A cryptographic checksum is a one-way
hash function; that is, it is computationally impractical to find
the input corresponding to a particular output.
This net result is
a
.Dq fingerprint
of the input-data, which does not disclose the actual input.
.Pp
The
.Fn SHA384_Init ,
.Fn SHA384_Update ,
and
.Fn SHA384_Final
functions are the core functions.
Allocate an
.Vt SHA384_CTX ,
initialize it with
.Fn SHA384_Init ,
run over the data with
.Fn SHA384_Update ,
and finally extract the result using
.Fn SHA384_Final .

.Sh HISTORY
These functions appeared in
.Dx 2.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The core hash routines were implemented by Colin Percival based on
the published
.Tn FIPS 180-2
standard.
.Sh BUGS
No method is known to exist which finds two files having the same hash value,
nor to find a file with a specific hash value.
There is on the other hand no guarantee that such a method does not exist.

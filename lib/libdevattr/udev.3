.In devattr.h
.Ft struct udev *
.Fn udev_new "void"
.Ft struct udev *
.Fn udev_ref "struct udev *udev_ctx"
.Ft void
.Fn udev_unref "struct udev *udev_ctx"

.Fn udev_get_dev_path "struct udev *udev_ctx"
.Ft void
.Fn udev_set_userdata "struct udev *udev_ctx" " void *userdata"
.Ft void *
.Fn udev_get_userdata "struct udev *udev_ctx"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn udev_new
function returns a new udev context.
This is needed as a context for all other libdevattr functions.
The returned context has a refcount of 1.
This function returns
.Dv NULL
if no udev context could be created, which usually happens when
the udevd daemon is not running.
.Pp
The
.Fn udev_ref
and
.Fn udev_unref
functions increase or decrease the reference count on a udev object respectively.
When the reference count drops to 0, the object is automatically destroyed.
The
.Fn udev_ref
function returns the same object that was passed in.
.Pp
The
.Fn udev_get_dev_path
function returns the path to the system device directory.
.Pp
The
.Fn udev_set_userdata
function allows the consumer to associate some
.Fa userdata
to the specified
.Fa udev_ctx .
The
.Fn udev_get_userdata
function returns the currently associated user data.

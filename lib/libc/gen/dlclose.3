.Dt DLCLOSE 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm dlclose
.Nd unlink shared object from process address space
.Sh LIBRARY
This function is not in a library.  It is included in every dynamically linked
program automatically.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dlfcn.h
.Ft int
.Fn dlclose "void *handle"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn dlclose
function
deletes a reference to the shared object referenced by
.Fa handle .
If the reference count drops to 0, the object is removed from the
address space, and
.Fa handle
is rendered invalid.
Just before removing a shared object in this way, the dynamic linker
calls the object's
.Fn _fini
function, if such a function is defined by the object.
.Pp
The object-intrinsic functions
.Fn _init
and
.Fn _fini
are called with no arguments, and are not expected to return values.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
The
.Fn dlclose
function
returns 0 on success, or -1 if an error occurred.
Whenever an error has been detected, a message detailing it can be
retrieved via a call to
.Fn dlerror .

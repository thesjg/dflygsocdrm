Setting up vknetd to give your test vkernel some connectivity.  There
are two easy ways of doing this.  First you can set up a bridge:

    ifconfig bridge0 create
    ifconfig bridge0 addm nfe0
    ifconfig bridge0 up
    /usr/sbin/vknetd -p /var/run/vknet -U -b bridge0

Second, you can set up a LAN just between the vkernel and the machine it
is running on. In your /etc/rc.conf you set:

   vknetd_enable="YES"
   vknetd_flags="10.30.0.1/16"

vknetd just sits there waiting for connections.  Any number of vkernels
can then attach to it. If you bridge you can use your normal LAN's dhcp
server and run dhclient on the vkernel.  If you set up a local LAN it
is easiest to simply configure the address by hand.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility may be used to make a dynamic binary memory-resident.
This works
by running the binary just past its DLL mmap's and relocation and then
making a copy of its vmspace.
The copy is registered in the kernel and later
exec's of the program will cause a copy of the copy to be used.
When
.Pa ld-elf.so
detects that it is running resident, it skips all initial library
loads (because they are already loaded).
.Pp
Care must be taken when using this program.
It is recommended that you
delete all resident registrations when updating the system shared libraries
and binaries.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl l
List binaries that are currently memory-resident.
.It Fl f
Force mode, even if the binary does not appear to be a dynamic binary.
This way you can run resident through statically compiled wrappers.  The first
dynamic binary encountered in the exec chain will be operated on.
.It Fl x Ar id
Delete a registration by id.
.It Fl d
Delete a registration by program name.
If neither of the above two options are specified a new registration is created.
.It Fl R
Delete all registrations in the kernel.

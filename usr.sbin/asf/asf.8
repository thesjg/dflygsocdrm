.Sh NAME
.Nm asf
.Nd add symbol files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl afk
.Op Ar modules-path Op Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
By default,
.Nm
reads
.Xr kldstat 8
output from standard input and writes to the
.Pa .asf
file a list of
.Xr kgdb 1
commands to add symbol files from KLDs in subdirectories of the subdirectory
.Pa modules
of the current directory, which is intended to be a kernel build directory.
This allows
.Xr kgdb 1
to load the symbols into the debugging environment.
.Pp
If
.Ar modules-path
is specified,
.Nm
uses it for the modules directory instead of the default
.Pa /boot/modules .
This is useful when building in a non-standard location (i.e., not
.Pa /usr/src
and
.Pa /usr/obj ) .
.Pp
If
.Ar outfile
is specified,
.Nm
writes to it instead of standard output.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options modify the function of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
When writing to an explicit
.Ar outfile ,
append to the file rather than overwriting it.
.It Fl f
Instead of trying to simplistically guess the path for each module, perform
a traversal in the same way that
.Xr find 1
does to locate an exact path for each module, no matter where in
.Ar modules-path
it is located.
.It Fl k
Instead of reading from standard input, start a
.Xr kldstat 8
and read the information from it.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The common usage on a
.Dx
system is sourcing the output of
.Nm Fl k
into
.Xr kgdb 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# asf -k
# [start kgdb...]
(kgdb) source .asf
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kgdb 1 ,
.Xr kldstat 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 5.2 .

.An Greg Lehey Aq grog@FreeBSD.org
.Sh BUGS
It should be possible to write to an
.Ar outfile
without specifying a module path.

.Sh NAME
.Nm fwcontrol
.Nd FireWire control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl rt
.Op Fl c Ar node
.Op Fl d Ar node
.Op Fl o Ar node
.Op Fl s Ar node
.Op Fl l Ar file
.Op Fl g Ar gap_count
.Op Fl b Ar pri_req
.Op Fl R Ar filename
.Op Fl S Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is designed to provide a way for users to access and control the
FireWire subsystem.
Without options,
.Nm
will output a list of devices those are/were connected to the bus.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl r
Initiate bus reset.
.It Fl t
Show the topology map.
.It Fl c Ar node
Show the configuration ROM on the node.
.It Fl d Ar node
Hex dump of the configuration ROM.
.It Fl o Ar node
Send a link-on phy packet to the node.
.It Fl s Ar node
Write to RESET_START register on the node.
.It Fl l Ar file
Load hex dump file of the configuration ROM and parse it.
.It Fl g Ar gap_count
Broadcast gap_count by phy_config packet.
.It Fl i Ar pri_req
Set PRIORITY_BUDGET register on all supported nodes.
.It Fl R Ar filename
Receive DV stream and dump it to a file. Use Ctl-C to stop the receiving.
Some DV cameras seem not to send the stream if a bus manager exits.
If you cannot get the stream, try the following commands.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl hw.firewire.try_bmr=0; fwcontrol -r
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting file contains raw DV data excluding isochronous header
and CIP header. It can be handled by
.Ic libdv
in the
.Xr pkgsrc 7
collection.
.It Fl S Ar filename
Send a DV file as isochronous stream.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /dev/fw0
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Each DV frame has fixed size and it is easy to edit those frame order.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
fwcontrol -R original.dv
.Ed
.Pp
Receive stream.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dd if=original.dv of=first.dv bs=120000 count=30
.Ed
.Pp
Get first 30 frames(NTSC).
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dd if=original.dv of=second.dv bs=120000 skip=30 count=30
.Ed
.Pp
Get second 30 frames(NTSC).
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cat second.dv first.dv | fwcontrol -S /dev/stdin
.Ed
.Pp
Swap first and second 30 frames and send them to DV recorder.
.Pp
For PAL, replace 'bs=120000' with 'bs=144000'.

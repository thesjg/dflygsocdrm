.Nm
.Op Fl DiOt
.Op Fl A Ns Ar mode

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small Mail Transport Agent (MTA), designed for home and office use.
It accepts mails from locally installed Mail User Agents (MUA) and
delivers the mails either locally or to a remote destination.
Remote delivery includes several features like TLS/SSL support and SMTP
authentication.
.Pp
.Nm
is not intended as a replacement for real, big MTAs like
.Xr sendmail 8
or
.Xr postfix 1 .
Consequently,
.Nm
does not listen on port 25 for incoming connections.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A Ns Ar mode
.Fl \&Ac
acts as a compatibility option for sendmail.
.It Fl b Ns Ar mode
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl bp
List all mails currently stored in the mail queue.
.It Fl bq
Queue the mail, but don't attempt to deliver it.
See also the
.Sq DEFER
config file setting below.
.El
.Pp
All other
.Ar mode Ns
s are are ignored.
.It Fl D
Don't run in the background.
Useful for debugging.
.It Fl f Ar sender
Set sender address to
.Ar sender .
.It Fl i
Ignore dots alone on lines by themselves in incoming messages.
This should be set if you are reading data from a file.
.It Fl L Ar tag

.Ar tag .
This is a compatibility option for sendmail.
.It Fl O
This is a compatibility option for sendmail.
.It Fl o Ns Ar option
Specifying

.Fl i .
All other options are ignored.
.It Fl q Ns Op Ar arg
Process saved messages in the queue.
The argument is optional and ignored.
.It Fl r Ar sender
Same as
.Fl f .
.It Fl t

.Nm

.Li To: ,
.Li Cc: ,
and
.Li Bcc:
headers.
The
.Li Bcc:
header will be removed independent of whether
.Fl t
is specified or not.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
can be configured with three config files:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
auth.conf
.It
dma.conf
.It
virtusertable
.El
.Pp
These three files are stored per default in
.Pa /etc/dma .
.Sh FILE FORMAT
Every file contains parameters of the form
.Sq name value .
Lines containing boolean values are set to
.Sq NO
if the line is commented and to
.Sq YES
if the line is uncommented.
Empty lines or lines beginning with a
.Sq #
are ignored.
Parameter names and their values are case sensitive.
.Sh PARAMETERS

.Pa auth.conf .
Each line has the format
.Dq Li user|smarthost:password .

will deliver all mails to this port, regardless of whether a smarthost is set
or not.
.It Ic ALIASES Xo
(string, default=/etc/mail/aliases)
.Xc
Path to the local aliases file.
Just stick with the default.

.It Ic DEFER Xo
(boolean, default=commented)
.Xc

.Nm

.El
.Ss virtusertable

Some smarthosts do not accept mails from unresolvable email address
(e.g.\& user@localhost) so you have to rewrite your outgoing email
address to a valid address.

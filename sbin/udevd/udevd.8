.Sh NAME
.Nm udevd
.Nd udev daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon attaches itself to the kernel's udev interface,
.Pa /dev/udev
and provides an interface for the
.Xr devattr 3
library to access the kernel's udev events and device properties.
The
.Nm
daemon has to be running for the
.Xr devattr 3
library to work.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility creates the file
.Pa /var/run/udevd.pid ,
and stores its process id there.
This can be used to kill
.Nm .

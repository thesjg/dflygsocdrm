.Sh NAME
.Nm kget
.Nd "print kernel change information"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows one to view or save any device configuration information
which was changed in a userconfig (-c) session.
.Pp
The
.Ar filename
argument specifies which file (or
.Sq -
for stdout) the information should be saved to.
If the file exists, it will be overwritten.
.Pp
Most typically, the information is written to a
.Pa /boot/kernel.conf
file which is then loaded from
.Pa /boot/loader.rc
(using
.Dq "load -t userconfig_script /boot/kernel.conf" ) ,
saving the user from having to re-enter it each time the system is booted.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 3.1 ,
as part of the PicoBSD distribution by
.An Andrzej Bialecki
.Sh BUGS
Sure to be some.

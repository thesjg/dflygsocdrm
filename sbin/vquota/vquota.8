.Sh NAME
.Nm vquota
.Nd VFS quota system utility
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Oo
.Fl D | h
.Oc
.Ar command
.Ar argument
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the
.Nm
utility which provides functions for managing virtual file system
accounting and quotas.
.Pp
To use the
.Nm
utility, the
.Va vfs.quota_enabled
tunable needs to be set in
.Xr loader.conf 5 .
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Debug flag, show raw messages sent to and received from kernel
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output. Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to four or fewer.
.It Fl n
Show raw user and group ids. Normally
.Nm
attempts to resolve and display full user and group names.
.El
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" ==== check ====
.It Cm check Ar directory
Reports the space (in bytes) occupied by files names located in the
directory hierarchy present under
.Ar directory .
.
.\" ==== lsfs ====
.It Cm lsfs
List mounted file systems having space accounting enabled
.
.\" ==== show ====
.It Cm show Ar mount_point
Show file size usage and quota limits for the file system mounted under
.Ar mount_point .
The information is broken down by uid and gid
.
.\" ==== sync ====
.It Cm sync Ar mount_point
Initialize in one go the usage counters for the filesystem
mounted under
.Ar mount_point
with real usage data. This command scans an entire filesystem
directory hierarchy and may be slow to run
.\" ==== limit ====
.It Cm limit Ar mount_point size
Set a global quota of
.Ar size
bytes for the filesystem mounted under
.Ar mount_point .
.\" ==== ulim ====
.It Cm ulim Ar mount_point user size
Set a quota of
.Ar size
bytes for the filesystem mounted under
.Ar mount_point
and the specified
.Ar user .
.\" ==== glim ====
.It Cm glim Ar mount_point group size
Set a quota of
.Ar size
bytes for the filesystem mounted under
.Ar mount_point
and the specified
.Ar group .
.El
.Pp
A limit of 0 effectively means checks are disabled.
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of a typical usage
of the
.Nm
command:
.Pp
.Dl "vquota show /mnt/data"

.Sh NAME
.Nm wmake
.Nd build DragonFly source in a buildworld environment
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar options ...
.Ar target ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
script allows you to build any element within the
.Dx
source tree
using a buildworld environment.
It is extremely useful for debugging or
development work.
Instead of having to restart the buildworld (even with
.Fl DNOCLEAN
and
.Fl DNOTOOLS
it can take a while) this script can be used to immediately build
whatever piece of the world you are working on.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility will accept all options and arguments that
.Xr make 1
accepts.
.Pp
To install things built with
.Nm ,
use:
.Bd -literal
$ wmake install INSTALL=install DESTDIR=/
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr make 1 ,
.Xr build 7

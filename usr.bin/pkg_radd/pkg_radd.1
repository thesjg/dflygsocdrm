.Dt PKG_RADD 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_radd
.Nd installs packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar package ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
acts as a wrapper for
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
It sets the
.Ev PKG_PATH
variable to the
.Dx
default
.Xr pkgsrc 7
binary package server or uses the global
.Pa /etc/settings.conf
config file to calculate
.Ev PKG_PATH .
In
.Pa /etc/settings.conf ,
set
.Ev BINPKG_BASE
to your favorite binary packages mirror URL to allow
.Nm
to automatically retrieve the latest set of binary packages for your
.Dx
release.
If you want to use a specific set of packages, set
.Ev BINPKG_SITES
instead.
.Pp
All options passed to
.Nm
are passed to
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is an example of a typical usage of the
.Nm
command:
.Pp
.Dl "# pkg_radd host"
.Pp
If you don't know which version of your desired package to install you can
use
.Xr pkg_search 1
to find the correct version.
.Pp
.Dl "# pkg_search fvwm2"
.Dl "# pkg_radd -v fvwm-2.4.20nb1"
.Pp
If you add the following line
.Pp
.Dl "BINPKG_BASE=http://mirror-master.dragonflybsd.org/packages"
.Pp
to
.Pa /etc/settings.conf ,
.Nm
fetches packages from the main
.Dx
server.
If possible, replace the entry with one of the mirrors as listed in
.Pa http://www.dragonflybsd.org/mirrors/ .

.Sh NAME
.Nm KASSERT ,
.Nm KKASSERT
.Nd kernel expression verification macros
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options INVARIANTS
.Fn KASSERT expression "const char *msg"
.Fn KKASSERT expression
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The macros described in this manual page are no-op unless the kernel
is compiled with
.Cd "options INVARIANTS" .
.Pp
The
.Fn KASSERT
macro tests the given
.Ar expression
and if it is false,
the
.Xr panic 9
function is called to display
.Fa msg
and terminate the running system.
.Pp
The
.Fn KKASSERT
macro is similar to
.Fn KASSERT ,
except it does not require a description message but instead
displays
.Fa expression
and terminates the running system.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The kernel function
.Fn vput
must not be called with a NULL pointer.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
void
vput(struct vnode *vp)
{
	struct thread *td = curthread;

	KASSERT(vp != NULL, ("vput: null vp"));
	...
}

.Ft void
.Fn lockinit "struct lock *lkp" "char *wmesg" "int timo" "int flags"
.Ft void
.Fn lockuninit "struct lock *lkp"

.Ft void
.Fn lockmgr_printinfo "struct lock *lkp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn lockinit
function is used to initialize a lock.
It must be called before any operation can be performed on a lock.
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fa wmesg"
.It Fa lkp
A pointer to the lock to initialize.
.It Fa wmesg
The lock message.
This is used for both debugging output and
.Xr tsleep 9 .
.It Fa timo
The timeout value passed to
.Xr tsleep 9 .
.It Fa flags
The flags the lock is to be initialized with.
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv LK_CANRECURSE"
.It Dv LK_NOWAIT
Do not sleep while acquiring the lock.
.It Dv LK_SLEEPFAIL
Fail after a sleep.
.It Dv LK_CANRECURSE
Allow recursive exclusive locks.
.It Dv LK_TIMELOCK
Use
.Fa timo
during a sleep; otherwise, 0 is used.
.El
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn lockuninit
function destroys a lock that was previously initialized using
.Fn lockinit .
.Pp
The
.Fn lockcount
function returns a count of the number of exclusive locks and shared locks
held against the lock
.Fa lkp .
.Pp
The
.Fn lockcountnb
function is a non-blocking counter-part of
.Fn lockcount .
which, can be safely used in assertion statements e.g. a
.Xr KASSERT 9 .
.Pp
The
.Fn lockmgr
function handles general locking functionality within the kernel, including
support for shared and exclusive locks, and recursion.
.Fn lockmgr
is also able to upgrade and downgrade locks.
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fa flags"
.It Fa lkp
A pointer to the lock to manipulate.
.It Fa flags
Flags indicating what action is to be taken.
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv LK_EXCLUPGRADE"
.It Dv LK_SHARED
Acquire a shared lock.
If an exclusive lock is currently held, it will be downgraded.
.It Dv LK_EXCLUSIVE
Acquire an exclusive lock.
If an exclusive lock is already held, and
.Dv LK_CANRECURSE
is not set, the system will
.Xr panic 9 .
.It Dv LK_DOWNGRADE
Downgrade exclusive lock to a shared lock.
Downgrading a shared lock is not permitted.
If an exclusive lock has been recursed, all references will be downgraded.
.It Dv LK_EXCLUPGRADE
Upgrade a shared lock to an exclusive lock.
Fails with
.Er EBUSY
if there is someone ahead of you in line waiting for an upgrade.
If this call fails, the shared lock is lost.
Attempts to upgrade an exclusive lock will cause a
.Xr panic 9 .
.It Dv LK_UPGRADE
Upgrade a shared lock to an exclusive lock.
If this call fails, the shared lock is lost.
Attempts to upgrade an exclusive lock will cause a
.Xr panic 9 .
.It Dv LK_RELEASE
Release the lock.
Releasing a lock that is not held can cause a
.Xr panic 9 .
.It Dv LK_SLEEPFAIL
Fail if operation has slept.
.It Dv LK_NOWAIT
Do not allow the call to sleep.
This can be used to test the lock.
.It Dv LK_CANRECURSE
Allow recursion on an exclusive lock.
For every lock there must be a release.
.El
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstatus
function returns the status of the lock in relation to the
.Vt thread
passed to it.
Note that if
.Fa td
is
.Dv NULL
and an exclusive lock is held,
.Dv LK_EXCLUSIVE
will be returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockmgr_printinfo
function prints debugging information about the lock.
It is used primarily by
.Xr VOP_PRINT 9
functions.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn lockcount
function returns an integer greater than or equal to zero.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockmgr
function returns 0 on success and non-zero on failure.
.Pp
The
.Fn lockstatus
function returns:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv LK_EXCLUSIVE"
.It Dv LK_EXCLUSIVE
An exclusive lock is held by the thread
.Fa td .
.It Dv LK_EXCLOTHER
An exclusive lock is held by someone other than the thread
.Fa td .
.It Dv LK_SHARED
A shared lock is held.
.It Li 0
The lock is not held by anyone.
.El
.Sh FILES
The lock manager itself is implemented within the file
.Pa /sys/kern/kern_lock.c .
Data structures and function prototypes for the lock manager are in
.Pa /sys/sys/lock.h .
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn lockmgr
fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBUSY
.Dv LK_NOWAIT
was set, and a sleep would have been required.
.It Bq Er ENOLCK
.Dv LK_SLEEPFAIL
was set and
.Fn lockmgr
did sleep.
.It Bq Er EINTR
.Dv PCATCH
was set in the lock priority, and a signal was delivered during a sleep.
Note the
.Er ERESTART
error below.
.It Bq Er ERESTART
.Dv PCATCH
was set in the lock priority, a signal was delivered during a sleep,
and the system call is to be restarted.
.It Bq Er EWOULDBLOCK
a non-zero timeout was given, and the timeout expired.
.El
.Sh LOCKS
Upgrade attempts that fail result in the loss of the lock that
is currently held.
Also, it is invalid to upgrade an
exclusive lock, and a
.Xr panic 9
will be the result of trying.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr panic 9 ,
.Xr tsleep 9 ,
.Xr VOP_PRINT 9
.Sh HISTORY
The lock manager appeared in
.Dx 1.0 .
.Pp
The lock manager API first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 lite2 .

.Sh NAME
.Nm syscall
.Nd "system calls overview"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A system call is an explicit request to the kernel made via a software
interrupt by some program.
For example,
.Fn open
is a system call that is used when access to a file stored in filesystem
is needed.
In this sense, system calls provide the interface between a process and the
operating system.
.Pp
The kernel implements system calls through a set of switch tables
for each emulation type.
The list of currently supported system calls along with their codes resides in
.Pa sys/sys/syscall.h .
This file, and a couple others which will be examined later, are
automatically generated and should not be edited manually.
.Pp
The first step in adding a new system call is to edit the
.Pa sys/kern/syscalls.master
file.
The
.Dq master
file is a text file consisting of a list of lines for each
system call.
Lines may be split by the means of back slashing the end of the line.
Each line is a set of fields separated by whitespace:
.Pp
.D1 Cd number type namespace ...
.Pp
Where:
.Bl -tag -width namespace -compact
.It number
is the system call number;
.It namespace
is one of POSIX, BSD, NOHIDE;
.It type
is one of:
.Bl -tag -width NOPROTO -compact
.It STD
standard system call with full prototype and implementation;
.It OBSOL
obsolete, not included in the system;
.It UNIMPL
unimplemented, not included in the system, placeholder only;
.It NODEF
included, but don't define the syscall number;
.It NOARGS
included, but don't define the syscall args structure;
.It NOPROTO
implemented elsewhere;
.It COMPAT
a compatibility system call, only included if the corresponding
option is configured for the kernel.
.El
.El
.Pp
The rest of the line for the STD, NODEF, NOARGS, and COMPAT
types is:
.Pp
.D1 Cd { pseudo-proto } [alias]
.Pp
.Nm pseudo-proto
is a C-like prototype used to generate the system call argument list,
and alias is an optional name alias for the call.
The function in the prototype has to be defined somewhere in
the kernel sources as it will be used as an entry point for
the corresponding system call.
.Pp
For other types the rest of the line is a comment.
.Pp
To generate the header and code files from the
.Dq master
file,
.Li make sysent
has to be run from the directory containing the
.Dq master
file.
Please mind that the string
.Li sys_
is prepended to all system call names, but not to the structures
holding the arguments.
So, if one has added the line:
.Bd -literal
503	STD	BSD	{ int mycall(int x, int y); }
.Ed
.Pp
to the system call master file, the generated prototype would be:
.Pp
.Ft int
.Fn sys_mycall "struct mycall_args *uap" ;
.Pp
It is customary to extract system call arguments with the
.Fn SCARG uap member
macro, which is defined in
.Pa sys/sys/sysent.h
file.
Last, in order to return a value to userland, the
.Fa uap->sysmsg_result
variable and friends of it are used, as defined in
.Pa sys/sys/sysmsg.h .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width sys/kern/syscalls.master -compact
.It Pa sys/kern/makesyscalls.sh
a
.Xr sh 1
script for generating C files out of the syscall master file;
.It Pa sys/kern/syscalls.conf

.It Pa sys/kern/syscalls.master

.It Pa sys/kern/syscalls.c
system call names lists;
.It Pa sys/kern/init_sysent.c

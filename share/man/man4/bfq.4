.Sh NAME
.Nm BFQ
.Nd Budget Fair Queueing disk scheduling policy
.Sh DESCRIPTION

.P 
The 
.Nm 
disk scheduler is invented by Paolo Valente. The current version of 
.Nm
in
.Dx is implemented according to his technique report. Also, some additional
features are added into the current version, they are inspired by the Linux
version, but are totally written from scratch.

.P 
Like the CFQ (Complete Fair Queue) disk scheduler under Linux,
.Nm
is a fair queueing scheduler that aims to improve the interactivity and
lower the latency of the system. Maximizing throughput, however, is not the
major design goal of it.  So it is better to switch to
.Nm 
if the computer is for desktop usage, in which interactivity eclipses
throughput in general.
.Ss Switching To BFQ
.P
.Nm
is compiled as a loadable kernel module by default. It should be loaded by
the kernel before you switching to it. You may use the
.Xr kldload 8 
command
to do so:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kldload dsched_bfq
.Ed

Alternatively, you can compile BFQ into the kernel by adding the following
line into your 
.Xr kernconf 5
:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
options DSCHED_BFQ
.Ed

.P
Then you may use
.Xr sysctl 8
to switch to 
.Nm
:

.Bd -literal -offset indent
sysctl dsched.policy.ad0=bfq
.Ed

Where "ad0" is the name of your hard drive.

.Ss Tuning BFQ
.P
Currently 
.Nm
has two tunable parameters: the global AS switch and the maximum budget.
They can be tuned by the
.Xr sysctl 8 command, for example:

.Bd -literal -offset indent
#enable the global AS feature:
sysctl dsched.bfq.ad0.as_switch=1 

#set the max budget to 512KB:
sysctl dsched.bfq.ad0.max_budget=524288 

#enable automatic max budget adapting:
sysctl dsched.bfq.ad0.auto_max_budget=0
.Ed

.Bl -tag -width indent
.It The AS feature

It is reported that turning AS on may affect the interactivity and increase
max latency greatly. It is probably due to the over-serialized
implementation of BFQ. However, the blogbench shows that turning AS
on will also increase the throughput greatly.

Suggestion: turn on the AS feature, for it effects little on average
latency.

.It The max budget

One thread could be assigned a budget no more than the max budget. Generally,
a higher budget means higher throughput because of less operations on
WF2Q+ augtree, while a lower budget force the scheduler cost more on
those operations.

However, the real world experiments show that a too high budget affects
interactivity heavily. A too low budget will also cause higher latency, and
if the budget is less than 64KB (65536), which is smaller than the size of
some bios , the scheduler will retrograde to a round-robin scheduler, which
is not a good form for a disk scheduler.

Suggestions: Do not use automatic max budget, it is usually too high. A
budget of 1/10 of the automatic max budget may be proper. In general,
512K(default), 256K, 192K can be good. It is better to determine the
best max budget by binary selecting by the result of some
benchmarks.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
scheduler first appeared in
.Dx 2.10 .

.Sh BUGS
.P
When switching to another dsched policy from BFQ, the system may deadlock.

.P
Currently, the overall performance is not very good and it is not tested on
large number of machines. It is not recommended to use this version in a
productivity environment.

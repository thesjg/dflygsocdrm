.Sh NAME
.Nm mfi
.Nd "LSI MegaRAID SAS driver"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device pci"
.Cd "device mfi"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mfi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver is for LSI's next generation PCI Express SAS RAID controllers.
Access to RAID arrays (logical disks) from this driver is provided via
.Pa /dev/mfid?
and access to JBOD disks is provided via
.Pa /dev/mfisyspd?
device nodes.
A simple management interface is also provided on a per-controller basis via
the
.Pa /dev/mfi?
device node.
.Pp
The
.Nm
name is derived from the phrase "MegaRAID Firmware Interface", which is
substantially different than the old "MegaRAID" interface and thus requires
a new driver.
Older SCSI and SATA MegaRAID cards are supported by
.Xr amr 4
and will not work with this driver.
.Pp
3 Gb/s and 6 Gb/s support both initiator target (IT) and integrated RAID (IR)
firmware (see
.Pa http://kb.lsi.com/KnowledgebaseArticle16266.aspx ) .
The
.Nm
driver supports controllers with an IR image.
At least some cards (such as the
.Tn IBM ServeRAID M1015 )
will attach to the
.Xr mps 4
driver when IT firmware is used.
.Pp
Two sysctls are provided to tune the
.Nm
driver's behavior when a request is made to remove a mounted volume.
By default the driver will disallow any requests to remove a mounted volume.
If the sysctl
.Va dev.mfi.%d.delete_busy_volumes
is set to 1,
then the driver will allow mounted volumes to be removed.

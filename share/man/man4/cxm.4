.Sh NAME
.Nm cxm
.Nd Conexant iTVC MPEG Coder
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in
your kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device iicbus"
.Cd "device iic"
.Cd "device iicbb"
.Cd "device cxm"
.Ed
.\".Pp
.\"Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
.\"following line in
.\".Pa /boot/loader.conf :
.\".Bd -literal -offset indent
.\"cxm_load="YES"
.\".Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the PCI
.Em video
capture on the Hauppauge PVR-250/350.
It uses the
.Xr bktr 4
and
.Xr meteor 4
ioctls.
.Pp
Note that in order for the
.Xr cxm 4
driver to work properly, the necessary firmware files have to be extracted
from the driver CD-ROM prior to compiling the kernel.
The tool necessary to do this can be found in
.Pa /usr/src/tools/multimedia/cxm/extract_fw .

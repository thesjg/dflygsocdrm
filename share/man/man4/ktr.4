.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
facility allows kernel events to be logged while the kernel executes so that
they can be examined later when debugging.
The only mandatory option to enable
.Nm
is
.Cd options KTR .
.Pp
The
.Dv KTR_ENTRIES
option sets the size of the buffer of events.
It should be a power of two.
The size of the buffer in the currently running kernel can be found via the
read-only sysctl
.Va debug.ktr.entries .
By default the buffer contains 2048 entries.
.Pp
For debugging purposes, the following
.Nm
related kernel options exist:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv KTR_SPIN_CONTENTION"
.It Dv KTR_ALL
turns on all options
.It Dv KTR_ETHERNET
cost of
.Fn ether_input_chain
and
.Fn ether_input_dispatch
.It Dv KTR_IF_BGE
.Xr bge 4
interrupts and sent/received packets
.It Dv KTR_IF_EM
.Xr em 4
interrupts, polling and sent/received packets
.It Dv KTR_IFQ
classic ifq dequeue/enqueue operation
.It Dv KTR_IF_START
running/avoiding/scheduling ifnet.if_start
.It Dv KTR_IPIQ
IPI related data (IPI requests, CPU synchronization etc.)
.It Dv KTR_KERNENTRY
entry of the kernel from userland (faults, syscalls)
.It Dv KTR_MEMORY
.Xr kmalloc 9
and
.Xr kfree 9
events
.It Dv KTR_POLLING
.Xr polling 4
begins and ends
.It Dv KTR_SERIALIZER
.Xr serializer 9
related events
.It Dv KTR_SPIN_CONTENTION
.Xr spinlock 9
contention
.It Dv KTR_TESTLOG
IPI performance testing
.It Dv KTR_TOKENS
LWKT token related events
.It Dv KTR_USB_MEMORY
USB memory allocation
.It Dv KTR_CTXSW
context switches
.El
.Ss Verbose Mode
By default, events are only logged to the internal buffer for examination
later, but if the verbose flag is set then they are dumped to the kernel
console as well.
This flag can also be set from the loader via the
.Va debug.ktr.verbose
environment variable, or it can be examined and set after booting via the
.Va debug.ktr.verbose
sysctl.
If the flag is set to zero, which is the default, then verbose output is
disabled.
If the flag is set to one, then the contents of the log message and the CPU
number are printed to the kernel console.
If the flag is greater than one, then the filename and line number of the
event are output to the console in addition to the log message and the CPU
number.
The
.Dv KTR_VERBOSE
option enables verbose mode and sets the flag to one.
.Ss Examining the Events
The KTR buffer can be examined with
.Xr ktrdump 8 ,
.Xr gdb 1
or from within
.Xr ddb 4
via the
.Ic show ktr Op Cm /v
command.
This command displays the contents of the trace buffer one page at a time.
At the
.Dq Li --more--
prompt, the Enter key displays one more entry and prompts again.
The spacebar displays another page of entries.
Any other key quits.
By default the timestamp, filename, and line number are not displayed with
each log entry.
If the
.Cm /v
modifier is specified, then they are displayed in addition to the normal
output.
Note that the events are displayed in reverse chronological order.
That is, the most recent events are displayed first.

.Sh HISTORY
The KTR kernel tracing facility first appeared in
.Bsx 3.0
and was imported into
.Fx 5.0
and
.Dx 1.1 .
It was completely rewritten by Matthew Dillon in
.Dx 1.3 .

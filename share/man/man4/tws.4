.Sh NAME
.Nm tws
.Nd 3ware 9750 series SATA/SAS RAID controllers driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following lines in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device scbus"
.Cd "device tws"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tws_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for LSI's 3ware 9750 series
SATA/SAS controllers.
.Pp
These controllers are available in 4, 8, 16 or 24-port configurations,
and support the following RAID levels: 0, 1, 10, 5, 50, 6.
The device nodes for the controllers are of the form
.Pa /dev/tws Ns Ar X ,
where
.Ar X
is the controller number.
The driver is implemented as a SCSI SIM
under CAM, and, as such, the logical units that it controls are accessible
via the device nodes,
.Pa /dev/da Ns Ar Y ,
where
.Ar Y
is the logical unit number.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
driver supports the following SATA RAID controllers:

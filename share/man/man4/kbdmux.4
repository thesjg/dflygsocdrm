.Sh NAME
.Nm kbdmux
.Nd "keyboard multiplexer"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device kbdmux"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
kbdmux_load="YES"
.Ed
.\".Pp

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
keyboard driver provides support for basic keyboard multiplexing.
It is built around the idea of a
.Dq "super keyboard" .
The
.Nm
driver
acts as a master keyboard consuming input from all slave keyboards attached to
it.
.Pp
Slave keyboards can be attached to or detached from the
.Nm
keyboard driver with the
.Xr kbdcontrol 1
utility.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kbdcontrol 1 ,
.Xr atkbd 4 ,
.Xr syscons 4 ,
.Xr ukbd 4
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
keyboard driver switches all slave keyboards into
.Dv K_RAW
mode.
Thus all slave keyboards attached to the
.Nm
keyboard share the same state.
The
.Nm
keyboard is logically equivalent to one keyboard with lots of duplicated keys.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
module was implemented in
.Fx 6.0 .
.Pp
It was imported into
.Dx 2.3 .

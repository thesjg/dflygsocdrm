.Sh NAME
.Nm sili
.Nd Silicon Image 3124/3132 SATA controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To compile this driver into the kernel,
place the following line in your
kernel configuration file:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Cd "device sili"
.Ed
.Pp
Alternatively, to load the driver as a
module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
sili_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for SATA controllers using the Silicon Image
3124/3132 SATALink chipsets. Both 3124-1 (1.5 Gbps) and 3124-2 (3 Gbps)
versions of the 3124 chip are supported.
.Pp
Although
.Nm
controllers are actual ATA controllers, the driver emulates SCSI via a
translation layer.
.Sh LOADER TUNABLES
The following hints may be set in
.Xr loader.conf 5
to control the
.Nm
driver's behavior.
Note that the hint need only exist, so removing it requires commenting it out.
.Pp
Usually both the
.Xr nata 4
and the
.Nm
drivers are loaded.
The
.Xr nata 4
driver will pick up any ata-like devices which the
.Nm
driver misses.
If the
.Nm
driver is disabled the
.Xr nata 4
driver will typically pick up the
.Nm
devices, albeit under the
.Pa ad
disk name rather than the
.Pa da
disk name.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hint.sili.disabled=1
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be told to force a lower-speed 1.5Gb link speed
if necessary, and can also be told to refrain from attempting to send
certain higher-level ATA commands to initialize ATA features which
some devices might not properly implement.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Dx 2.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was originally written by
.An David Gwynne Aq dlg@openbsd.org
and
.An Christopher Pascoe Aq pascoe@openbsd.org
for
.Ox .
.Pp
It was ported to
.Dx
by
.An Matt Dillon Aq dillon@apollo.backplane.com
who added new features such as hot-plug and port multiplier support.

/*
 * This code does two things necessary for the enhanced TCP metrics to
 * function in a useful manner:
 *  1) It marks all non-host routes as `cloning', thus ensuring that
 *     every actual reference to such a route actually gets turned
 *     into a reference to a host route to the specific destination
 *     requested.
 *  2) When such routes lose all their references, it arranges for them
 *     to be deleted in some random collection of circumstances, so that
 *     a large quantity of stale routing data is not kept in kernel memory
 *     indefinitely.  See in_rtqtimo() below for the exact mechanism.

/*
 * Callbacks in the USB code operate in a critical section.
 *
 * It is conceivable that this arrangement could trigger a condition
 * where the input queues could get trampled in spite of our best effors
 * to prevent it. To work around this, we implement a special input queue
 * for USB ethernet adapter drivers. Rather than passing the frames directly
 * to ether_input(), we pass them here, then schedule a soft interrupt to
 * hand them to ether_input() later, outside of the USB interrupt context.
 *
 * It's questional as to whether this code should be expanded to
 * handle other kinds of devices, or handle USB transfer callbacks
 * in general. Right now, I need USB network interfaces to work
 * properly.

 * Derived from hp300 version by Mike Hibler, this version by William
 * Jolitz uses a recursive map [a pde points to the page directory] to
 * map the page tables using the pagetables themselves. This is done to
 * reduce the impact on kernel virtual memory for lots of sparse address
 * space, and to reduce the cost of memory to each process.

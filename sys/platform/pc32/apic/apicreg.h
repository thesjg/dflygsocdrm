 *		    The Task Priority Register provides a priority threshold
 *		    mechanism for interrupting the processor.  Only interrupts
 *		    with a higher priority then that specified in the TPR will
 *		    be served.   Other interrupts are recorded and serviced
 *		    as soon as the TPR value decreases enough to allow that
 *		    (unless EOId by another APIC).
 *
 *		    PRIO (7:4).  Main priority.  If 15 the APIC will not
 *		    		 accept any interrupts.
 *		    SUBC (3:0)	 Sub priority.  See APR/PPR.
 *
 *
 *		    The Processor Priority Register determines whether a
 *		    pending interrupt can be dispensed to the processor.  ISRV
 *		    Is the vector of the highest priority ISR bit set or
 *		    zero if no ISR bit is set.
 *
 *		    IF TPR[7:4] >= ISRV[7:4]
 *			PPR[7:0] = TPR[7:0]

 *		    lowest-priority arbitration.

 *
 *		    The logical APIC ID is used with logical interrupt
 *		    delivery modes.  Interpretation of logical destination
 *		    information depends on the MODEL bits in the Destination
 *		    Format Regiuster.  
 *
 *		    MODEL=1111 FLAT MODEL - The MDA is interpreted as
 *					    a decoded address.  By setting
 *					    one bit in the LDR for each
 *					    local apic 8 APICs can coexist.

 *
 *		    Spurious interrupt vector register.  The 4 low
 *		    vector bits must be programmed to 1111, e.g.
 *		    vvvv1111.
 *
 *		    E - LAPIC enable (0 = disable, 1 = enable)
 *
 *		    F - Focus processor disable (1 = disable, 0 = enable)
 *
 *		    NOTE: The handler for the spurious interrupt vector
 *		    should *NOT* issue an EOI because the spurious 
 *		    interrupt does not effect the ISR.

 *
 *		    These registers represent 256 bits, one bit for each
 *		    possible interrupt.  Interrupts 0-15 are reserved so
 *		    bits 0-15 are also reserved.
 *
 *		    TMR - Trigger mode register.  Upon acceptance of an int
 *			  the corresponding bit is cleared for edge-trig and
 *			  set for level-trig.  If the TMR bit is set (level),
 *			  the local APIC sends an EOI to all I/O APICs as
 *			  a result of software issuing an EOI command.
 *			  
 *		    IRR - Interrupt Request Register.  Contains active
 *			  interrupt requests that have been accepted but not
 *			  yet dispensed by the current local APIC.  The bit is
 *			  cleared and the corresponding ISR bit is set when
 *			  the INTA cycle is issued.
 *
 *		    ISR - Interrupt In-Service register.  Interrupt has been
 *			  delivered but not yet fully serviced.  Cleared when
 *			  an EOI is issued from the processor.  An EOI will
 *			  also send an EOI to all I/O APICs if TMR was set.

 *				101 INIT.  Deliver as an INIT signal to all
 *				    processors (like FIXED).  Vector is ignored
 *				    and it is always edge-triggered.
 *
 *				110 Start Up.  Sends a special message between
 *				    cpus.  the vector contains a start-up
 *				    address for MP boot protocol.

 *	NOTE ON EOI: Upon receiving an EOI the APIC clears the highest priority
 *	interrupt in the ISR and selects the next highest priority interrupt
 *	for posting to the CPU.  If the interrupt being EOId was level
 *	triggered the APIC will send an EOI to all I/O APICs.  For the moment
 *	you can write garbage to the EOI register but for future compatibility
 *	0 should be written.

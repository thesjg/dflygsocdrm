	 * GENERAL NOTES
	 *
	 *	- interrupts are always called with a critical section held
	 *
	 *	- we release our critical section when scheduling interrupt
	 *	  or softinterrupt threads in order so they can preempt
	 *	  (unless we are called manually from a critical section, in
	 *	  which case there will still be a critical section and
	 *	  they won't preempt anyway).
	 *
	 *	- TD_NEST_COUNT prevents splz from nesting too deeply within
	 *	  itself.  It is *not* actually an interrupt nesting count.
	 *	  PCPU(intr_nesting_level) is an interrupt nesting count.
	 *
	 *	- We have to be careful in regards to local interrupts
	 *	  occuring simultaniously with our doreti and splz 
	 *	  processing.
	 *
	 *	- Interrupts must be enabled when calling higher level
	 *	  functions in order to avoid deadlocking against things
	 *	  like smp_invltlb.

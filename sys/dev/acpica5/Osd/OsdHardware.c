 * ACPICA's rather gung-ho approach to hardware resource ownership is a little
 * troublesome insofar as there is no easy way for us to know in advance 
 * exactly which I/O resources it's going to want to use.
 * 
 * In order to deal with this, we ignore resource ownership entirely, and simply
 * use the native I/O space accessor functionality.  This is Evil, but it works.

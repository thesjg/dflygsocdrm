 *
 *	The 'valid' and 'dirty' fields are distinct.  A page may have dirty

 *  normal page.  Pages not under PV management cannot be paged out
 *  via the object/vm_page_t because there is no knowledge of their
 *  pte mappings, nor can they be removed from their objects via 
 *  the object, and such pages are also not on any PQ queue.  The
 *  PG_MAPPED and PG_WRITEABLE flags are not applicable.
 *
 *  PG_MAPPED only applies to managed pages, indicating whether the page
 *  is mapped onto one or more pmaps.  A page might still be mapped to
 *  special pmaps in an unmanaged fashion, for example when mapped into a
 *  buffer cache buffer, without setting PG_MAPPED.
 *
 *  PG_WRITEABLE indicates that there may be a writeable managed pmap entry
 *  somewhere, and that the page can be dirtied by hardware at any time
 *  and may have to be tested for that.  The modified bit in unmanaged
 *  mappings or in the special clean map is not tested.
 *
 *  PG_SWAPPED indicates that the page is backed by a swap block.  Any
 *  VM object type other than OBJT_DEFAULT can have swap-backed pages now.
 *
 *  PG_SBUSY is set when m->busy != 0.  PG_SBUSY and m->busy are only modified

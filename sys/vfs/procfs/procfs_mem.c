 * wait() all maintain the p_textvp field in the
 * process proc structure which contains a held
 * reference to the exec'ed vnode.
 *
 * XXX - Currently, this is not not used, as the
 * /proc/pid/file object exposes an information leak
 * that shouldn't happen.  Using a mount option would
 * make it configurable on a per-system (or, at least,
 * per-mount) basis; however, that's not really best.
 * The best way to do it, I think, would be as an
 * ioctl; this would restrict it to the uid running
 * program, or root, which seems a reasonable compromise.
 * However, the number of applications for this is
 * minimal, if it can't be seen in the filesytem space,
 * and doint it as an ioctl makes it somewhat less
 * useful due to the, well, inelegance.

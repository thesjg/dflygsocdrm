 * Random lookups in the cache are accomplished with a hash table using
 * a hash key of (nc_src_vp, name).  Each hash chain has its own spin lock.
 *
 * Negative entries may exist and correspond to resolved namecache
 * structures where nc_vp is NULL.  In a negative entry, NCF_WHITEOUT
 * will be set if the entry corresponds to a whited-out directory entry
 * (verses simply not finding the entry at all).   ncneglist is locked
 * with a global spinlock (ncspin).
 *
 * MPSAFE RULES:
 *
 * (1) A ncp must be referenced before it can be locked.
 *
 * (2) A ncp must be locked in order to modify it.
 *
 * (3) ncp locks are always ordered child -> parent.  That may seem
 *     backwards but forward scans use the hash table and thus can hold
 *     the parent unlocked when traversing downward.
 *
 *     This allows insert/rename/delete/dot-dot and other operations
 *     to use ncp->nc_parent links.
 *
 *     This also prevents a locked up e.g. NFS node from creating a
 *     chain reaction all the way back to the root vnode / namecache.
 *
 * (4) parent linkages require both the parent and child to be locked.

 * It turns out that (1) is a huge mess.  It takes a nice clean set of 
 * namecache algorithms and introduces a lot of complication in every subsystem
 * that calls into the namecache to deal with the re-merge case, especially
 * since we are using the namecache to placehold negative lookups and the
 * vnode might not be immediately assigned. (2) is certainly far less
 * efficient then (1), but since we are only talking about directories here
 * (which are likely to remain cached), the case does not actually run all

 * Unresolved entries must be resolved through the filesystem to associate the
 * vnode and/or determine whether a positive or negative hit has occured.

/*
 * Implements new VFS/VM coherency functions.  For conforming VFSs
 * we treat the backing VM object slightly differently.  Instead of
 * maintaining a number of pages to exactly fit the size of the file
 * we instead maintain pages to fit the entire contents of the last
 * buffer cache buffer used by the file.
 *
 * For VFSs like NFS and HAMMER which use (generally speaking) fixed
 * sized buffers this greatly reduces the complexity of VFS/VM interactions.
 *
 * Truncations no longer invalidate pages covered by the buffer cache
 * beyond the file EOF which still fit within the file's last buffer.
 * We simply unmap them and do not allow userland to fault them in.
 *
 * The VFS is no longer responsible for zero-filling buffers during a
 * truncation, the last buffer will be automatically zero-filled by
 * nvtruncbuf().
 *
 * This code is intended to (eventually) replace vtruncbuf() and
 * vnode_pager_setsize().

/*
 * Truncate a file's buffer and pages to a specified length. The
 * byte-granular length of the file is specified along with the block
 * size of the buffer containing that offset.
 *
 * If the last buffer straddles the length its contents will be zero-filled
 * as appropriate.  All buffers and pages after the last buffer will be
 * destroyed.  The last buffer itself will be destroyed only if the length
 * is exactly aligned with it.
 *
 * UFS typically passes the old block size prior to the actual truncation,
 * then later resizes the block based on the new file size.  NFS uses a
 * fixed block size and doesn't care.  HAMMER uses a block size based on
 * the offset which is fixed for any particular offset.
 *
 * When zero-filling we must bdwrite() to avoid a window of opportunity
 * where the kernel might throw away a clean buffer and the filesystem
 * then attempts to bread() it again before completing (or as part of)
 * the extension.  The filesystem is still responsible for zero-filling
 * any remainder when writing to the media in the strategy function when
 * it is able to do so without the page being mapped.  The page may still
 * be mapped by userland here.
 *
 * When modifying a buffer we must clear any cached raw disk offset.
 * bdwrite() will call BMAP on it again.  Some filesystems, like HAMMER,
 * never overwrite existing data blocks.

 * The spin_lock() inline was unable to acquire the lock.
 *
 * atomic_swap_int() is the absolute fastest spinlock instruction, at
 * least on multi-socket systems.  All instructions seem to be about
 * the same on single-socket multi-core systems.  However, atomic_swap_int()
 * does not result in an even distribution of successful acquisitions.
 *
 * Another problem we have is that (at least on the 48-core opteron we test
 * with) having all 48 cores contesting the same spin lock reduces
 * performance to around 600,000 ops/sec, verses millions when fewer cores
 * are going after the same lock.
 *
 * Backoff algorithms can create even worse starvation problems, and don't
 * really improve performance when a lot of cores are contending.
 *
 * Our solution is to allow the data cache to lazy-update by reading it
 * non-atomically and only attempting to acquire the lock if the lazy read
 * looks good.  This effectively limits cache bus bandwidth.  A cpu_pause()
 * (for intel/amd anyhow) is not strictly needed as cache bus resource use
 * is governed by the lazy update.
 *
 * WARNING!!!!  Performance matters here, by a huge margin.
 *

 *	48-core test with pre-read / -j 48 no-modules kernel compile
 *	came in at 75 seconds.  Without pre-read it came in at 170 seconds.

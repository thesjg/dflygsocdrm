<@buggs> BSD had hacker called Matt
<@buggs> And all his patches were fat
<@buggs> But the whining masses cried like a kid
<@buggs> And took away his commit bit
<@buggs> But he still was coding high
<@buggs> And put them all in DragonFly

<@coolvibe> I left alone, my mind was blank. I needed time to get the mutexes
	from my mind. What did I see, can I believe, that what I saw that
	night was real and not just fantasy
<@coolvibe> just what I saw, in that old code, where they reflections of those
	past hacks staring back at me
<@coolvibe> cos in my dreams, it's always there, the evil lock that twists my
	mind and brings me to dispair!
<@coolvibe> the night was black, was no use holding back, cus I just had to
	see, was someone watching me.
<@coolvibe> In the mist, dark hackers move and twist, was all this for real,
	or some kind of hell
<@coolvibe> 6 66, the number of the beasty
<@coolvibe> hacks and locks were spawned to be released
<@coolvibe> compilers blazed, and sacred chants were praised, as they start
	to cry, hands held to the sky
<@coolvibe> in the night, the locks were spinning bright, the ritual has
	begun, beasties work is done
<@coolvibe> six, six six, the number of the beastie, sacrifice is going on
	tonight

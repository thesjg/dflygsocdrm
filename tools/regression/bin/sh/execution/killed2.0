# Most shells print a message when a foreground job is killed by a signal.
# POSIX allows this, provided the message is sent to stderr, not stdout.
# Some trickery is needed to capture the message as redirecting stderr of
# the command itself does not affect it. The colon command ensures that
# the subshell forks for ${SH}.
